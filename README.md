# VBA-challenge

**This module is for writing VBA scripting to analyse stock market data. **

The script loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

•	The ticker symbol.

•	Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
[Yearly change = closing price - opening price at the beginning]

•	The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
[percentage = (Yearly change / 1st opening price) *100%] 

•	The total stock volume of the stock.

•	Conditional formatting that will highlight positive changes in green and negative changes in red.

•	Summary of the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".
